This is a very, very simple desktop client for Gmail. It is essentially a webview for Gmail's mobile site, with Material design elements using the [qml-material](https://github.com/papyros/qml-material) library. 

# Installation

First, have Go installed and properly configured. Then use the "go get" command to automatically clone and build this repository.

Alternatively, on x86_64 Linux, just download the included compiled binary.
